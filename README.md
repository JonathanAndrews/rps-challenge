# RPS Challenge

Task
----

Knowing how to build web applications is getting us almost there as web developers!

The Makers Academy Marketing Array ( **MAMA** ) have asked us to provide a game for them. Their daily grind is pretty tough and they need time to steam a little.

Your task is to provide a _Rock, Paper, Scissors_ game for them so they can play on the web with the following user stories:

```sh
As a marketeer
So that I can see my name in lights
I would like to register my name before playing an online game

As a marketeer
So that I can enjoy myself away from the daily grind
I would like to be able to play rock/paper/scissors
```

## Bonus level 1: Multiplayer

Change the game so that two marketeers can play against each other ( _yes there are two of them_ ).

Strategy
--------

1. My first step was to breakdown the user stories into Objects and Messages.
2. Then I created a Sequence and Class diagram detailing how the Class interact.
3. I then built the system using the Sinatra web framework.
